# FINOS Legend GitLab Integrator

## Description

The Legend Operators package the core [FINOS Legend](https://legend.finos.org)
components for quick and easy deployment of a Legend stack.

This repository contains a [Juju](https://juju.is/) Charm for
deploying a service which exposes a pre-existing GitLab endpoint
for the other Legend components.

The full Legend solution can be installed with the dedicated
[Legend bundle](https://charmhub.io/finos-legend-bundle).


## Usage

The Legend Gitlab Integrator can be deployed by running:

```sh
$ juju deploy finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s --channel=edge
```


## Relations

The standalone Integrator will initially be blocked, and will require being
related to the Legend components for it be ready to be configured with GitLab
Creds:

```sh
# Relate to the legend services:
$ juju relate finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s finos-legend-sdlc-k8s
$ juju relate finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s finos-legend-engine-k8s
$ juju relate finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s finos-legend-studio-k8s
```

## GitLab Configuration:
### A: Using private GitLab (recommended)

Prerequisites:
* a private GitLab deployment configured to use HTTPS
* a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) for the GitLab

```bash
juju config finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s \
    gitlab-host=10.107.2.9 gitlab-port=443 access-token="CqVrcbHOMeU="
```

### B: Using pre-created GitLab application

Prerequisites:
* access to the portal of [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) or the private GitLab
* application creation rights on said account

#### Creating the GitLab Application:
* login to Gitlab
* Go top-left to User Settings > Applications
* Create a new application with the following:
  - Name: "Legend Demo"
  - Confidential: yes
  - Scopes: openid, profile, api
  - Redirect URI: set it to http://localhost:8080/callback
* __Save the Client ID and Secret for later__

#### Setting the GitLab application creds:

```bash
# NOTE: one may optionally add the following, else it defaults to gitlab.com:
# api-scheme=http gitlab-host=10.107.2.9 gitlab-port 443
juju config finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s \
    bypass-client-id=<cliend id> \
    bypass-client-secret=<client secret>
```

#### Fetching the redirect URIs:

Once the `finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s` becomes `active`:
```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ juju status | grep gitlab
finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s/0*  active    idle   10.1.184.238

user@ubuntu:~$ juju run-action finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s/0 get-redirect-uris
Action queued with id: "2"

user@ubuntu:~$ juju show-action-output 2
UnitId: finos-legend-gitlab-integrator-k8s/0
id: "2"
results:
  result: |-
    http://10.1.184.224:6060/api/callback
    http://10.1.184.236:7070/api/auth/callback
    http://10.1.184.236:7070/api/pac4j/login/callback
    http://10.1.184.241:8080/studio/log.in/callback
status: completed
timing:
  completed: 2021-09-27 18:50:39 +0000 UTC
  enqueued: 2021-09-27 18:50:38 +0000 UTC
  started: 2021-09-27 18:50:38 +0000 UTC
```

#### Setting the above redirect URIs into GitLab:
* log back into your GitLab portal
* go to the application created previously
* edit the Redirect URI setting of the application
* paste the output of the `result` field from the `juju show-action-output`
  command run previously

### Application reconfiguration or reuse:

Due to intentional security-minded limitations in the GitLab APIs, the client ID and
secret of existing applications cannot be queried programatically, and can only be known
if creating an application on the spot.

In this sense, reusing GitLab applications upon redeploying the integrator will
require taking one of the following options:
1. *reusing an existing GitLab application* can be achieved by reconfiguring the
   charm using the `bypass-client-id` and `bypass-client-secret` configuration
   options with the client ID/secret which can be obtained from
   the GitLab Web user interface as described in section .B above.
2. manually deleting the application and having the integrator create a new one on the next run
3. reconfiguring the integrator with the `application-name` config option to create a new
   application with a different name. Note that this does NOT clean up/replace the old app.
